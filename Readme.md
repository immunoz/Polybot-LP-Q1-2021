# PolyBot - @UltraSamBot

This project implements a telegram bot that makes computation with polygons. The bot creates convex poligons given a set of vertices and can execute operations with them like:
* Intersection
* Convex Union
* Bounding Box
* Check if a polygon is inside other
* Check wether two polygons are equal
* Draw polygons
* Compute the centroid of a polygon
* Compute the number of vertices of a polygon

You can find the statement of this project in the following [link](https://github.com/jordi-petit/lp-polimomis-2020)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In order to configure the environment to execute the porject on your machine, first install python 3 (download link [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) and execute the following commands on your machine:

```
pip3 install pillow
pip3 install python-telegram-bot
pip3 install antlr4-python3-runtime
 or
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime

```
to install antlr4:
* Download the jar file from this [link](https://www.antlr.org/download.html)
* Follow the instructions on this [link](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md)

Apart, from this intallations you can use PyCharm with Antlr4 plugin to work more comfortly.

## Running the tests

Inside the project you will find this distribution of files:
* cl
	* PolygonTreeVisitor.py (Contains the implementation of our visitor)
	* main.py (Has a code to interact with the visitor)
	* ConvexPolygon.g (Contains the grammar of our programming language)
* Bot
	* bot.py (Contains the implementation of the Telegram bot)
	* token.txt (Contains the token of out Telegram bot)
* polygons.py (File that contains the implementation of polygons.py)
* requirements.txt (File that contains the requirements of this project)
* Readme.md

Note that inside cl folder there are more than the specified files, those are generated when compiling the ConvexPolygon.g with antlr4.

The statement was divided in three parts.

### First part: create a class to work with convex polygons
You can find the implementation in the polygons.py file and use this class to do operations with convex polygons, just import it to your project.

### Second part: create a programming language to work with convex polygons using antlr with python

To compile the grammar use the following command:
```
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 -no-listener -visitor ConvexPolygon.g
```

Once the grammar is compiled, you can use the PolygonTreeVisitor.py to make operations with polygons.

Inside the PolygonTreeVisitor class there is a map named variables that will store the variables created by the user.

Most of the operations inside the visitor return Polygons, but sometimes just returns a string with the result of the operation done.

### Third part: create a bot to interact with convex polygons
When the grammar has been created, execute the bot using the following command inside the bot folder:
````
python bot.py
````
When the bot is running just talk to @UltraSamBot, he will guide you and help you with /help command.
### Coding style

This project has been written following the PEP8 style rules.
